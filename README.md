# Shot-Cafe-movie-shot-analysis
 Project developed for the exam of Big Data computing. The code includes a set of python notebooks that implement different approaches for movie shot classification and clustering tasks.

## Project structure
The project is divided into three sections. Section 0 is represented by a notebook for exploring the dataset and creating the subdataset needed for each task. Section 1 concerns the task of classifying the different types of shot, section 2 the task of classifying the environment of the scene (interior or exterior), finally section 3 concerns the task related to the clustering of the color palettes of the film shots.
